- 👋 Hi, I’m Nur Adriana Azman
- 👀 I’m interested in combining science with practical solutions in aquaculture and sustainability. With experience in genetic research and breeding management, I’m driven by the goal of improving sustainable practices in the industry.
- 🌱 I’ve also gained valuable skills in operations management and problem-solving through running an e-commerce business, and I’m currently expanding my knowledge in telecommunications to bring new tech insights into my work.
- 💞️ I’m excited to contribute to projects that promote sustainability, innovation, and positive change in aquaculture and beyond.
